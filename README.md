This repository just created to keep all solved problem code of AlgoDaily practice side. I am solving Problem because I like solving problems. And its long time since I done some problem solving.  

Site from where problems are solved : 

1. https://algodaily.com/challenges
2. https://app.codility.com/programmers


Language used to solve the problem is Golang. Choose this language becuase just started learning this language and I found it very intreseting. This will give me hands on syntax for golang.

I also included test cases and test covrage as well along with code. 

To run a test cases just run command  > go test -v
To get test covarage data run > go test -cover
To get covarage in file run > go test -coverprofile=cover.txt --<This name coud be anything you want>
To make that readable report > go tool cover -html=cover.txt  -o cover.html



Hopefully this will help anyone else as well.
